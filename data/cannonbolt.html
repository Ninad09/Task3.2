        <div class="content">Cannonbolt is a hulking, broad-shouldered alien covered in natural, yellow armor plating on his back, shoulders, and the backs of his arms. He is mostly white with black on his upper half and has four claws on both of his hands, having a color scheme and claws similar to that of a panda. Cannonbolt is covered in fur across the thickest parts of his body, while every other part except for his elbows and knees is short fur.</div>
        <h1 style="padding: 25px;">Powers and Abilities</h1>
        <div class="content">Cannonbolt can curl into a ball, encasing himself in his plating. In general, the Arburian Pelarota species mostly used this maneuver for defense, like an armadillo. However, since Ben did not know about this when discovering Cannonbolt, he weaponized Cannonbolt's originally defensive capabilities.

            When rolled up, Cannonbolt becomes like a motorized wheel that can move at great speed (because of chemicals in his exo-plates that reduce friction) and can increase his rotational momentum to slam into and/or run over enemies. Cannonbolt is able to maneuver around his surroundings in ball form thanks to the short fur on his body, registering shifts in air and motion around him.</div>
