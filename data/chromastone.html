        <div class="content">Chromastone is a silicon-based alien made of extremely durable crystal. His body is overall indigo, with several dark lines and spots. His hands and face are magenta, and he also sports six magenta shards on his back, two on his chest, and one on the top of his head that resembles a horn. His face consists of a mouth and one large green eye at the center.</div>
        <h1 style="padding: 25px;">Powers and Abilities</h1>
        <div class="content">Chromastone has the ability to allow many types of energy, such as lasers, electricity, mana, and radiation to phase through his body without harm.

            Chromastone can absorb and channel energy into ultraviolet beams powerful enough to melt through a truck trailer and destroy an entire turret. He can fire these beams from either his hands or from the nine shards on his body and can project these beams as either energy blasts or projectiles. He can even absorb big stars like Rigel.</div>
