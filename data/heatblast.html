        <div class="content">Heatblast is a plasma-based life-form whose body is composed of a super hot inner plasma body covered by a dark red or brown volcanic rocks. As a fire-based entity, his body radiates high amounts of heat. His feet have a slight oval-like design with only two toes and one back toe. His tongue is also made of fire.</div>
        <h1 style="padding: 25px;">Powers and Abilities</h1>
        <div class="content">Being one of Ben's most versatile alien forms, Heatblast is a pyrokinetic, meaning he has the ability to generate and manipulate intense heat and fire from his body. He can form fire into any shape that he chooses, commonly fireballs. He can also enhance the fire in his hands for flaming punches, and can breathe fire like a dragon. To top it all off, he can even absorb heat and fire at the same time. This means he can put out a fire faster than he can start one.</div>
