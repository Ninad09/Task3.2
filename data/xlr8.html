        <div class="content">XLR8 resembles a semi-armored Velociraptor. He has black orbs on his feet and wears a black cone-like helmet with a sliding protective visor (that is part of his Kineceleran biology and not mechanical). His visor is made up of his skin and part of his skull. Whenever his visor is lifted, one can see his blue face, green eyes, black lips, and stripes running under and in between his eyes; the rest of his head's features are unknown. XLR8 has five blue stripes on his tail and wears black pants and a turtleneck-like shirt with a white stripe on the center.</div>

        <div class="content">XLR8 can manipulate friction to reach speeds of 500 miles per hour within two seconds. He can accelerate so quickly that time appears to completely stop to him, allowing him to change the positions of things around him while they are moving. Kinecelerans seem to become faster as they grow older, seeing how XLR8 was capable of travelling globally in just a few seconds when used by Ben 10,000</div>
