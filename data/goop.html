        <div class="content">Being a 200-pound, single celled-organism that is neither liquid nor solid but a colloidal suspension, Goop is a humanoid pile of goo that can take any shape at will. Goop has bright green eyes and an Anti-Gravity Projector that allows him to be mobile in Earth's gravity and also projects his voice. His brain is spread throughout his body</div>
        <h1 style="padding: 25px;">Powers and Abilities</h1>
        <div class="content">Goop is indestructible, making it difficult to defeat him by attacking his body.

            Goop is able to generate and shoot slime from any part of his body. The slime he generates can either be acidic or adhesive. He can shoot it in continuous streams similar to a water hose or in blob-like projectiles. He is even capable of spitting out either slime or acid despite having no visible mouth</div>
