        <div class="content">Way Big is a white colossal humanoid creature with a large fin on his head, which is black at the front and red at the bottom. He has blade-like growths on his shoulders and spikes on his waist. He also has red arms with two black lines and white fins on the elbows, wristband-like outgrowths on his wrists and yellow eyes on his head with two extra eyes protruding on his cheeks, one on each. He has red feet with two toes, a black sandal-like covering on the middle of his feet and three black lines on the side of his neck. The red parts of Way Big's body are made of an unknown cosmic material with metallic properties.[DJW 1] In the classic series, Ben 10,000's Way Big is identical to this design.</div>
        <h1 style="padding: 25px;">Powers and Abilities</h1>
        <div class="content">Way Big is very strong (even for his size), being able to hurl targets into orbits from planets with an atmosphere as thick as Earth's, as shown when he threw Vilgax (who was Way Big's size at the time) into orbit from Primus. He can even lift objects larger and heavier than him, as he managed to lift the Hyperspace Jump Gate. Technically speaking, he is powerful enough to destroy a small planet</div>
